This is the code used for my Master Thesis in Sociology at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles (ULB).

The fieldwork of this study was the video game Paragon, made by Epic Games. Paragon had a short life and ceased to exist in 2018. My goal was to use Sentiment Analysis in order to understand what were the reasons that led the game to its closure. The comments used for this thesis came from the subbredit r/Paragon. 

The Sentiments Analysis here was done in 3 phases. 

First by dividing the comments in two groups. The words used to subset the sample were "Legacy" and "Monolith". These two words refer to the two big eras of the game before its closure. The results were not conclusive but they led to a different kind of sampling, by elements of the game.

Secondly by dividing all comments by dates. This led to a more comprehensive analysis. The sentiment analysis was not conclusive but it gave a clearer idea of when and what debates where about. This led to a confirmation on the importance of the elements found earlier.

Finally the third and last part of the sentiment analysis was based on the elements of the game that were most discussed. This gave a much more clear idea on the relationship between the developers and the players of the game.

In addition you can find some text analysis that was used to understand the content of the comments.
